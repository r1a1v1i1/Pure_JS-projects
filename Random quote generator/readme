## To-Do List Application

This is a simple JavaScript application that functions as a to-do list. You can add new tasks, mark them complete, and the list persists through page refreshes using localStorage.

### Features:

* Add new tasks.
* Mark tasks as completed.
* Completed tasks are visually distinguished.
* To-do list persists through page refreshes.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/to-do-list-app.git
   ```

   Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

2. **Open the application:**

   Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### Usage

1. Enter your new task in the text box.
2. Click the "Add" button to add the task to the list.
3. Click the checkbox next to a task to mark it as completed.

**Note:** This is a basic to-do list and doesn't include features like editing tasks or due dates. You can extend it further based on your needs.

### Technologies Used

* HTML: Provides the structure of the web page.
* JavaScript: Handles user interactions and manipulates the DOM to update the list.
